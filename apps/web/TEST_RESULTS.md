# Test Results: Cloudflare Pages Configuration

## ✅ Test Deployment SUCCESS

A simple HTML test page works perfectly:
- **Deployment URL**: https://52ef3b4b.agent-explorer.pages.dev ✅ Returns 200
- **Custom Domain**: https://www.8004-agent.com ✅ Returns 200

This proves:
1. ✅ Cloudflare Pages deployment works
2. ✅ Custom domain routing works
3. ✅ DNS is configured correctly
4. ✅ SSL certificates work

## ❌ Problem: Next.js App Router Deployment

When deploying `.next` directory:
- Upload succeeds
- Files are deployed
- But all routes return 404

## Root Cause

**Cloudflare Pages doesn't know how to serve Next.js App Router files from `.next` directory**.

This is a configuration issue, not a DNS or domain issue.

## The Solution

Cloudflare Pages needs to be told this is a Next.js app. Two ways:

### Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard Configuration (Recommended)

Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → agent-explorer → Settings → Builds & deployments

**Set**:
- Framework preset: **"Next.js"** (currently likely "Other" or blank)
- This tells Cloudflare how to handle the build

Then let Cloudflare build from Git automatically instead of using Wrangler CLI.

### Option 2: Use @cloudflare/next-on-pages Adapter

Keep using Wrangler but create proper output:

1. Build with adapter:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm build:cloudflare
   ```

2. This creates `.vercel/output/static/` that Cloudflare understands

3. Deploy that directory instead of `.next`

## Next Steps

**Check Cloudflare Dashboard**:
1. Go to Pages → agent-explorer → Settings
2. Look at "Framework preset"
3. Tell me what it says

This is the missing configuration!
